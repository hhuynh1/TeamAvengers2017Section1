Town Hub  
A dusty road leads into town and a tumbleweed rolls across your path. In the town square there is a statue of a menacing looking figure with a sheriff’s badge on. The buildings look a bit run down and people seem to shuffle from place to place without interacting. To the East there is a bustling saloon. To your North-West you see a drug store and to the South-West, an Inn.  
Drug Store  
A mostly bare room with a worn down looking counter top. Glass bottles full of medicine line the walls, but they look as if they haven’t been touched in years. You could almost measure the amount of dust accumulation on them. A man with a large mustache and a tattered suit stands behind the counter looking hopeful. To the South is a small passageway leading into a small, dimly lit, room and to the East is the door leading to the Town Hub.  
Inn  
You walk into the inn and you see a counter with a bell on it. There doesn’t appear to be anyone around, but you see a few rooms with the doors closed. There are a few dusty painting hanging on the wall, they look like they have seen better days. There is a hallway to the North that leads into a larger, well lit room and to the East is the door to the Town Hub. The inn keeper comes up before you get a chance to ring the bell and asks you if you want a room.  
Saloon  
This is the most people you have seen in one place. The bar is filled with forlorn looking people drowning their sorrows in alcohol. There is a poker table in the back, men in expensive looking suits sit at it smoking cigars and laughing. As you walk in, you notice that all eyes are on you. The barkeep gives you an inquisitive look, and then goes back to wiping down the bar with a rag that is dirtier than the bar. You notice a large door with a padlock on it to the South and to the West is the door to the Town Hub.  
Jail  
A small room with a couple of cells in the corner. The Deputy Sheriffs desk is in the other corner. As the Deputy Sheriff shoves you into the cells, you notice a small window. Between the bars of the window you can see the sun shining down on your horse, waiting for you outside.
